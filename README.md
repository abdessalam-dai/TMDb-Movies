# TMDb Movies Dataset Analysis
## by Abdessalam Dai


## Overview

This is the first project in Udacity's Nanodegree Program for Data Analysis. In this project, I analyzed the dataset and produced a file that outlines the results for sharing. I started by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions we could answer using it. Then, I used NumPy and pandas to respond to the questions that most interested us, and I produced a report to share the results. (Finalized on 14 December 2022).

## Dataset

This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. It has 21 columns. The columns that I used in my analysis are:

- **popularity**: The movie's popularity
- **budget**: The movie's budget
- **revenue**: The movie's revenue
- **original_title**: The movie's title
- **cast**: The movie's cast
- **director**: The movie's director
- **keywords**: The movie's keywords
- **runtime**: The movie's runtime
- **genres**: The movie's genres
- **production_companies**: The movie's production companies
- **vote_count**: The movie's vote count
- **vote_average**: The movie's average vote
- **release_year**: The movie's release year

## Questions

I asked the following questions:

- How many movies were released each decade?
- Which actors have most appearances in movies?
- Which actors are most frequent in the top 500 movies?
- Which directors directed most movies?
- Which directors are most frequent in the top 500 movies?
- Which production companies made most movies?
- What are the Top 10 most frequent genres?
- Which genres are most popular?
- Which genres have the highest rating?
- Which 3 genres are most popular from decade to decade?
- What are the most popular keywords?
- What are the Top 10 movies with heighest budget?
- What are the Top 10 movies with heighest revenue?
- What are the Top 10 most popular movies?
- What are the Top 10 movies by average vote?
- What are the relationships between revenue, budget, popularity and average vote?


## Summary of Findings

- Every year, more movies are released.
- More than any other actor, actors like Robert De Niro and Samuel L. Jackson have appeared in numerous films. With over 40 films under their belts.
- Woody Allen holds the record for most films directed.
- The studios that produced the majority of films were Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, and Paramount Pictures.
- Over decades, genre interest changes.
- Adventure, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Action, and Animation are the most watched genres.
- The top five genres for viewers' ratings are war, music, animation, documentaries, and history.
- Avatar, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Titanic, The Avengers, and Jurassic World are the top-grossing films.
- Jurassic World, Mad Max, Interstellar, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Insurgent are the most well-liked films.
- There is a high correlation between budget and revenue, and between popularity and revenue. So the more money spent on the production of a movie, the higher chance of its success.
